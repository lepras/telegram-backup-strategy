Okay so a important information or guide whatever you want to call it

One sunny day you wake up and see your telegram account go poof. Strange, right? Well not really, Telegram is deleting accounts randomly for apparently no reason. My account was recently deleted (has been recovered now) and now I am seeing many similar cases, hence this guide -

If one day you see your telegram number banned and your account gone, first stop panicking and

First Part-

mail recover@telegram.org, support@telegram.org and paste the same in telegram.org/support. Make sure to put your phone number which was banned and your mail which is linked with telegram phone no (if any)( if you have mail attached with telegram account then better to mail from that). 

Do's and Don'ts:

1. Make a professional mail and
don't use colocial language in that. The mail should be a clean formal one

2. Sometimes you will see your number is unbanned but account is still not alive in that case never create new account else you will loose everything if you do that. Be patient and you will get your number unbanned plus your telegram account with all your chats and history. Alternatively if you see your username active and try to login and tg says to make a new account then pls don't do it else all your data will be gone.

3. Telegram may not reply to you via mail or anything you need to keep checking your account and number (click on your old username if you remember, when it will show your old account, then everything is back and you should login immediately).

4. Don't spam by mailing multiple times. One time is enough.

Second Part -

After you get your account back you will be limited for lifetime (in short you will won't be able to comment in public groups ever). To fix that pm @Spambot and type a formal message (like telegram banned your account for no reason and after mailing them they unbanned but now i am limited) telling everything. After 10-15 minutes your rate limit should be gone

Some important points:

> Don't lie or misuse this guide for anything else you can get restricted for a lifetime.

> You can msg in discuss group incase you need help. Be straight to the point pls

> If you want to share this, then link it (like this https://t.me/juznem/1464) instead of forwarding because I will be updating this based on more user's experience. Don't come ranting in my pm if you see an outdated guide somewhere and something happens.

> Don't Forget to check the updates section for more info

Warning: There is no Guarantee this guide will help you get back your accounts. I am just writing this gathering everyone's opinion and take no responsibility of your accounts.

Updates (This section will be for extra information which i gathered from users) :

1. I have noted that telegram tends to ignore small(small in sense no info one) msgs so try to write a detailed one. Not an essay but not a two liner mail either.

2. Don't pm any stranger unless this issue is solved , Mostly people chatting with DC accounts other than theirs is getting flagged. Also don't chat in any public groups for time being.

3. Mostly real numbers which people are using for like 4-5 years old and fully legit are getting banned, voips are not getting banned which is strange as fuck. At this point i doubt if it's because of telegram new anti spam api or because of telegram voip service from fragment

4. Another pattern i saw is you will get to know when you are getting banned(not necessarily). Incident like this are warning that you will soon get banned - a random user said "i was just dming someone, and then got a popup 'you can only message mutual contacts', i clicked ok, and it opened the chat of the spam bot said my account was limited, then 30 seconds later i got logged out and then says phone number banned"

5. Also, I have already mentioned this in the main guide but I am still saying it again. Don't make a new account if Telegram asks, after you login into a number. If you do it, all your history will vanish and your old account will be gone forever. Whenever you see Telegram asking you to make a new profile logout and mail again.
